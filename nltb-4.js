<h3> When There's Nothing Left to Burn, Chapter 4 </h3>
<p> Written by strix_alba on AO3 </p>

<hr>
<br>
<p>
When Ballister agreed to help figure out his country’s government problem, he had — as he did with most of his projects, to be honest — vastly underestimated the amount of time and resources that he would need in order to get to the point where he could begin to figure out how to approach the problem. That is to say, in order to rebuild a government, he would first have to learn how a government worked. As soon as he had approached the Royal Library with a petition for research materials, the librarian had directed him to an entire room of the library, with strategically placed sliding ladders to make accessing the top shelves easier. Ballister had attempted to read the treatises and philosophic texts on the nature of government, and realized that he had come up against a fairly large roadblock.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fortunately, this time, he was not in uncharted territory. It turned out that there were dozens of people who studied governments the same way that he studied villainous plots, and they were all too willing to help him figure out how to write one. It had only been a matter of putting out advertisements in as many newspapers as he could find within a day’s traveling distance (thirty-seven); arranging a drop-off point for applications (the egg-seller’s stall at the Alchemists’ Street Market); and then sorting through the applicants to find ones who weren’t secretly serving the cause of the Institution or otherwise unqualified to help him reorganize the parts of the kingdom's government that had been controlled by the Institution.
</p>
<br>
<p>
His lab is his most productive place to go over applications as they come in; the atmosphere is familiar even if the work is not. He sits down with a large batch of applications during the afternoon at the end of the week, and forgets to stop until he is startled out of his work by a soft knock on the door in the wee hours of the morning.
</p>
<br>
<p>
When he opens it, Goldenloin is there, wrapped in a blanket, sitting stiffly in his wheelchair with his hair in a limp mess around his head.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I saw the light on,” he says. “What are you doing?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister clutches a few resumes to his chest. “Trying to decide if Fleur Vistia is more or less qualified to help me determine the fate of the kingdom than Zaid Lionjoy. Do you know what any of this means? She says she has “experience constructing credit databases to track federal tax sectoral statistics in the commercial fields.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin reaches out towards the papers with his good arm. “May I?” Ballister lets him take the whole stack, shifting them away from his body so that they are easier to reach. Goldenloin studies it, bleary-eyed but with the determined frown on his face that Ballister recognizes from jousting practice and fencing tournaments and lessons on heroic poetry. His face falls into lines easier than in Ballister’s memory, but that only makes sense; they are no longer callow youths. There are dark circles under his eyes, and Ballister remembers that he should have been asleep hours ago.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Why are you still awake?” he asks.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“The right hand of righteousness never sleeps,” Goldenloin says, which isn’t an answer. He rests his chin in his hand. “Why are you even considering McIntyre? Her resume is full of short-term fluff jobs that only look good at a glance. She wouldn’t be reliable; she’d abandon the government if you didn’t give her a powerful enough position.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I expressly wrote in the announcement that I'm only interested in rebuilding the government. No one here is going to get first dibs on official positions just because they helped create them," Ballister points out. Goldenloin should know that.
</p>
<br>
<p>
But Goldenloin waves him off with an elegant turn of his wrist, eyes never leaving the page. “Doesn’t matter. There will always be those who are willing to turn any situation to their advantage.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I know that,” Ballister mutters darkly.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You’re not one of them. It doesn’t come naturally to you, so you can’t imagine that anyone else would think like that,” says Goldenloin, and his eyes have left the page now and no, Ballister can see where this is going and it’s the middle of the night and he’s trying to avoid ruling the kingdom without ruining everything and he doesn’t have the energy to deal with a heart-to-heart right now; if he tries to divide his attention between helping the kingdom and sorting out his feelings, he's afraid that one or both of them will be doomed to failure. He isn't willing to risk either, so he sidesteps the compliment entirely, instead. “You inferred from her application?” he asks.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin beckons him closer; Ballister circles around so that he can read over Goldenloin’s shoulder. “I don’t know anything about how to build a government, but I was in the room for the Director’s hiring sessions. I remember some of the things she said.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I don’t want to base my advisory committee on anything that the Director created,” Ballister is quick to point out.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Some things were okay. Not as many as I thought,” Goldenloin responds. “Anyway. I’m going to get water like I wanted to do before I saw that your light was still on. You should go to sleep, too.” He hands the resumes back to Ballister with a sleepy smile.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister accepts the papers; on an impulse, he bends over to kiss the top of his head, hand at Goldenloin's temple. “I will,” he says. “Good night, Ambrosius.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister retreats to his room shortly thereafter. His work stays in the lab, but it still feels like a long time before he is calm enough to sleep.
</p>
<br>
<p>

</p>
<br>
<p>
The total number of candidates (after a morning spent reviewing applications with Goldenloin at the public chess tables, guarded by Nimona in the form of an enormous gray wolf; followed by an afternoon and early evening at the headquarters of the Society for the Responsible Redistribution of Scientific Advancement presenting their conclusions to the SRRSA and a small contingent of reporters) comes to thirteen.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“This is good,” says Dr. Swanfoot. “Do you want me to call them now and let them know?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister shakes his head. “Put it up to a vote. You can do that,” he says to the reporters. “Put the list of candidates in the newspapers and broadsides. Tell people to to write in their opinions to the station, or the... newspaper headquarters.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
A reporter with her quill sticking out from behind her ear stands up at the back of the room. “Sir Blackheart, a question from the Old Town Examiner, New Typeset Edition. Aren’t you worried that encouraging the public to express possible discontent with your Institution-dissolution committee choices will undermine your authority?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What kind of question is that?” Goldenloin cuts in, scowling, before Ballister has a chance to answer. “Sir Blackheart is only here because he cares about fixing the wrongs that the Institution committed. If he loses respect because people don’t want him to care about them, then he has their respect for the wrong reason.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister coughs. Goldenloin looks up at him, cheeks red. “Nothing more to add,” says Ballister. “Jaz, could you please copy the names and resumes of the dissolution committee for the press? Misspelled names would look lazy.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
After the meeting is finished, Ballister guides Goldenloin’s wheelchair out of the building and into the Chariot of the Temporary King, which is slightly nicer than a horse-and-cart taxi in that it has passenger seats built into the cart, and a little red flag on a stick waving from the back to show how important they are. He wraps an arm around his friend’s waist and helps him into his seat — Goldenloin can stand up, and walk for short distances, but steps up, and the actual act of sitting down, are still difficult. Dr. Fayadse deems it likely that he will be able to walk unassisted within a year. All things considered, Ballister is grateful.
</p>

Ballister wakes up a few days later with Nimona curled up on his chest, a small grass snake wearing one of her own earrings as a necklace. He smothers his first instinct upon waking (which is to fling the snake across the room and take up his sword from its place under the bed) and takes a few deep, calming breaths. Nimona has a tightly wound curl of paper in her tail. The header of the paper, all that is visible for now, informs him that he is looking at this week’s edition of the Old town Examiner (New Typeset Edition). He reaches for the paper and wakes up Nimona, who slithers away and somersaults back into herself.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Morning, boss,” she says. “You and Sir Fancypants made the tabloids. Can I go tell him? I wanna see his face.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What?” Ballister sits up. Nimona unfurls the paper and reads it aloud to him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Seen yesterday at the latest meeting of his campaign office, Sir Ballister Blackheart was accompanied by former Institution darling turned renegade hero, Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin. Sir Goldenloin became defensive over questions of Sir Blackheart’s motives in releasing his list of candidates to the public; the two were seen leaving the meeting together. Sources formerly employed by the Institution confirmed that the two were close childhood friends. Followup will be necessary to determine if nostalgia could possibly cloud our new leader’s judgment when it comes to selecting his advisers. Betcha couldn’t see that one coming,” Nimona says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister groans.
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister is shocked when he looks at a calendar and realizes that nearly three months have passed since the collapse of the Institution (though he’s not sure whether it feels like far longer, or far less time than that: every day seems to stretch on for at least thirty-six hours, but when taken together, weeks at a time fly by).
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What’s the plan for today, boss?” Nimona appears in the doorway of the living room, scrubbing at her eyes with the sleeve of a fuzzy sweater that clashes magnificently with her hair.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister sets down his current design plans for the jaderoot disintegrator — which has been sadly neglected for the past month and a half. “I’m taking Sir Goldenloin to physical therapy, and as long as the latest round of candidates all made it through the public approval polls, meeting the full committee to start discussions this afternoon.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Boring,” Nimona pronounces.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I would be testing more prototypes in my laboratory right now if you hadn’t decided to turn the kingdom into a republic.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona wanders past him towards the kitchen. “Still boring. I’m gonna join a gang and set the bank on fire.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You already burned down the bank.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“There’s got to be more than one bank around here!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Nimona.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
He can hear the refrigerator door being opened. “Don’t worry about me,” she calls back to him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister shakes his head. If he had ever followed that advice, his life would be very different. The sound of plastic wrappers rustling reminds him that he should eat, and he follows Nimona into the kitchen, notebook in hand.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona is sitting on the counter, kicking her heels and eating cereal. “You could let me be king as you,” she suggests. “That’d be interesting and have nothing to do with gangs.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“No,” says Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
She grins. “I can do a really good impression. Look!" She shifts, speaking in his voice. "All shall kneel before King Blackheart! Annual science fairs are now mandatory in every town!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
—“Nimona”—
</p>
<br>
<p>
—“This is my royal consort Queen Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin,”—
</p>
<br>
<p>
—“Stop that,”—
</p>
<br>
<p>
—“And this is my new right-hand woman, the Duke of Invention, Lord Doctor Meredith Blitzmeyer.” Nimona gives him a stern, regal stare, both arms slung around invisible shoulders, cereal forgotten.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Your grasp of titles leaves something to be desired,” says Ballister. He avoids looking at his own face. “It would be ‘Your Grace’ Blitzmeyer, anyway.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona leans back against the cabinets, shifting back into herself. “You’re tempted.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
He crosses his arms. “Not in the slightest.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She mimics his posture. “Fine. But if I go off on my own and get arrested, you’ll bail me out of jail, right?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister doesn’t know whether to laugh or to scold her or to curl up in a ball and weep tears of some nameless, complicated emotion wedged between confusion and frustration and profound relief. He compromises by striding across the room and folding her into the tightest hug that he can manage, burying his face in her shoulder. “Of course,” he tells her.
</p>
<br>
<p>

</p>
<br>
<p>
The next twenty-five days pass by in a wintery, protracted blur: Ballister only remembers how many of them there are because he takes notes. He shuttles himself and Goldenloin between his headquarters and the temporary palace, where he and his committee have taken over a rather nice ballroom so that they — along with their audience of reporters at the end of every day, waiting for a summary — can discuss things in a setting with proper lighting and sturdy walls. Nimona spends most of the time patrolling the palace as a bird, or a snake, or a wolf. If she ever does need to defend the ballroom against angry aristocrats, or former members of the Institution out on bail, or marauding griffins, then Ballister never hears about it. On one occasion, she meets him outside of the palace with someone else's knife in her hand and a few rapidly-healing injuries that are gone by the time they make it back to their headquarters.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He doesn’t ask.
</p>
<br>
<p>
At night, they traipse back to Ballister’s headquarters. Ballister’s culinary skills are limited to a dozen dishes that Cook from the orphanage taught him over ten years of kitchen-duty sanctions for breaking orphanage regulations; and Goldenloin’s are nonexistent; so they usually find supper on the way home. Occasionally, Nimona will take over the kitchen to recombine large quantities of food and fill the adjoining rooms with bizarre scent combinations of spices, honey, and blood sausages. When that happens, Goldenloin flees to his room until the smell dissipates, while Ballister retreats to his lab, or to his room, or gives up and collapses into a chair to stare at the rug that he doesn’t remember being in front of the hearth a month ago.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Somewhere in between endless discussions of spreadsheets and the divisions of judicial power among local feudal lords — both at the palace and at home, until Nimona shuts off the video screen and demands that they do something fun for once — Ballister and Goldenloin find time to spend together quietly. They don’t leave the house much without Nimona, even though Ballister is almost able to fend for himself these days. Tension is still high in the streets: uncertainty over the knowledge that the kingdom has irrevocably crossed a threshold into a new era. Ballister sees more print media in the streets than he has in a while. People hang banners from their windows and balconies and clotheslines calling for further castigations of the Institution, for the rebuilding of the Institution “but fixed”, supporting Ballister as monarch, supporting him and his dissolution committee, opposing all of the above, and a few that depict Nimona on the night that she broke free of the Institution, which he gathers from context is the result of a small group of angry anarchists. The streets thrum with energy, and neither he nor Goldenloin can leave the house without attracting some kind of attention.
</p>
<br>
<p>
They stay within the confines of Ballister’s headquarters, instead. Ballister has to fumigate the lab after discovering that one of the secondary components of his current jaderoot disintegration solution produces a sticky, foul-smelling vapor when it comes into contact with steel. While he's waiting for the lab to clear, he rearranges the furniture in the back room to make way for a chess table that he accepts — reluctantly — when Nimona brings it home from the park. (”It’s the sad one. No one ever uses it,” she claims.) Chess is one thing that he and Goldenloin can both still do, since horseback riding, climbing the orphanage’s huge pine trees, and exploring the city are off the table for the moment. They build up the fire against the cold and bicker over which version to use, and insult the mental fortitude of each other’s pawns, and then Goldenloin captures his second castle and Nimona appears in the doorway to inform them that Zaid Lionjoy called to say that he and his sub-committee had finished with their new tax law drafts.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Finally,” says Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I brought home fireworks so we can celebrate,” she adds. “Big ones!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin gives Ballister a lopsided smile — an expression that Ballister is starting to recognize might not be a temporary quirk, but a permanent reminder of their battle — and shrugs. “We could never see them from the orphanage when they set them off at the palace,” he says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister looks from him to Nimona, who is bouncing on the balls of her feet, and he knows that some battles just aren’t worth fighting. He sighs.
</p>
<br>
<p>
She pumps her fists in the air. “Yes!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
Once the tax laws have been wrapped up, (children will no longer be accepted as acceptable payment for debts, no matter how serious, and Ballister signs off on that part of their new constitution with Nimona sitting robin-shaped on one shoulder and Goldenloin’s hand on his other shoulder and he definitely doesn’t get emotional at a table full of scholars and accountants) and the committee still hasn’t reached a consensus on what to do with the Institution’s research materials, Ballister decides that if he is supposedly in charge of rebuilding the government, then he can damn well take a few (citizen-approved) liberties. Even if they might be ever-so-slightly self-interested.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Would you like to teach?” he asks Nimona.
</p>
<br>
<p>
She interrupts what she’s doing — at this moment, it involves tearing into a whole duck with her long curved fangs, watching a tape of an old jousting tournament in the living room. She turns to him slowly, a stray feather hanging from her fangs. Ballister waits. Nimona swallows, which requires her to tilt her head back and gulp a little like a pelican.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What?” she asks.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The microwave dings in the kitchen, and when Ballister opens the door, the scent of asparagus quiche greets him like a loving and slightly musty old friend. He welcomes it into his hands and joins Nimona on the opposite end of the couch out of the way of any stray bits of duck. "Sir Goldenloin and I were discussing what we would like to do after this is finished. He wants to renovate the orphanage where we grew up. I’m going to open a university,” he tells her. “There should be a place for the sort of research that the Institution claimed to be doing. In ethical amounts. Would you want to help?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona pauses the movie. Her face can be difficult to read when it’s not fully human. Ballister had expected a quick answer — a jubilant affirmative or a snickered no — but Nimona appears to actually be giving it some thought.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What would I teach?” she asks, shrinking her teeth back to a normal size. “I can’t make people into shapeshifters. I could teach about how to rob banks, but you’re supposed to be a big hero now … also, I’m supposed to be dead.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Her tone is casual, but her posture is stiff and hunched over her dinner. Ballister straightens his own back, but mimics her casual tone. “I agree that the kingdom is not ready for your particular set of skills. Perhaps when the university is better established,” he suggests, but Nimona shakes her head.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"I don't know enough science. I just drink things that might be poison and see what happens."
</p>
<br>
<p>
"I only thought — if you needed something to do, there will be a place for you." He frowns at the floor, unsure of whether to say more. "Or whoever you want to be."
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona tips her head to the side. “I like being your sidekick. You need someone to hang around and make sure you remember how to be evil.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister hesitates. “Then you are staying after this is done?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona puts her duck down on the table. She scoots across the couch to him, arranging herself cross-legged with one knee knocking against him. Ballister wraps an arm around her shoulders, and she leans against him. “You got it, boss.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
The line rings three times before Dr. Blitzmeyer picks up.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Sir Blackheart — you’re the one who broke my prototype! What brings you here today?” she says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’m sorry about that." Ballister pauses and waits for the sound of careful hammering on Blitzmeyer's end to die down. "How is the new one coming along?” he asks.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Fine, fine. I added some more layers of refraction to the glass on the main container just in case you need to borrow it again. That friend of yours sure did a number on it."
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Oh. That’s … very generous of you, thank you. I don’t need any specific items this time. I have a favor to ask of you. And an offer.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What’s the favor? I’ve been working on turning my energy source collector into a workable battery. No luck yet, but if you want a look at the prototypes…” In the background, Ballister hears papers shuffling and then being tossed aside.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister does want to look at the prototypes, very much. He would like to study them in detail and show them to Nimona, if only because she is the only one who has any understanding of how her energy works. Unfortunately, he has to focus. ”Actually, I’m going to open a university. Do you want to help?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
A pause. “Is that the offer or the favor?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister frowns. “…It was supposed to be the offer. I have most of the former Institution’s treasury at my disposal. I can pay you to do research.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Do I get to keep copyright on work that I do with university materials?” she asks doubtfully.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You get copyright, and the university would get first bid on purchasing rights.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Okay, that’s an offer. What’s the favor?” she asks, sounding considerably more enthused.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You have friends right? Other scientists?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Well, most of my friends are from my knitting group or my poetry club. But I’ve got plenty of colleagues.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Are any of them good at teaching?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
"That depends. Jamie is great to work with, but try to get her to explain alternating currents for a lay audience and it's a disaster. Lupe just retired but you know what that means, she's just trying to avoid more deadlines. And let's see, Blockhead is, huh, actually forget about him ..."
</p>
<br>
<p>
"So, yes?" says Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"I can think of a couple. Us scientists have got to stick together."
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Do you think they would come teach for the university if I made them a similar offer?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
There's a pause on the other end; Ballister can hear Dr. Blitzmeyer open a door, and then the sound of many small, metallic objects cascading down from a height, and aborted curses. He winces in sympathy. “I’ll see what I can do," says Dr. Blitzmeyer a moment later, sounding a little out of breath. "I’ve got a poet friend who teaches composition, you want me to talk to him too?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister blinks. “I hadn’t thought about that." The Institution had focused entirely on the sciences, with enough history taught and studied to understand the current political climate. But even though that was the way it had been done for as long as he could remember, it didn't have to stay that way, did it? That's what this is all about. "I’ll let you know. Do you have my number?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She hums for a moment. The door shuts again. “Better give it to me again, just in case. My workshop is a mess right now.”
</p>
<br>
<p>

<p>
The Temporary King Blackheart’s Institution Dissolution Committee meets for the last time eighty-four days after their first convocation. All major items have been resolved, but there are still signatures to add onto different copies of documents, and a few errata to put into order. The hum of almost-released tension in the room prickles against Ballister’s skin, making him itch unreasonably as they proceed through the agenda, marching towards the conclusion of nearly three months' uninterrupted work. Everyone else feels it too; he can tell from the way that the other members of the committee fidget around the table, the way that someone keeps kicking at one of the table legs rhythmically until one of the Institution’s former account managers snaps that whoever is doing that needs to stop before they break their casualty-free streak of legislation-writing.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The last thing to be written into the new constitution is a provision to keep Princess Isabel safe and out of power, as well as her great-aunt and all of the royal pets. Zaid Lionjoy reads aloud the conclusion, and it is unanimously voted into action. They pass the paper around so that they can each sign it. Ballister gets it last: a long roll of vellum with thirteen signatures at the end. He adds his name near the bottom of the roll, caps his pen, and looks around.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Thank you,” he says. “I’ve made more long speeches in the last four or five months than I ever planned on, so I won’t this time.” The announcement is met with a short round of applause. “Thank you, all of you, for your help. I would never be able to do any of this without you. All of you. Does anyone else want to say anything?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
They do, as it turns out. One woman extols their probable place in history books; another tells them that they’re probably doomed to failure, but she’s proud to have helped with something that was, at least, done in good faith; and so on.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister drops the stone gavel for the last time. Everyone rises, a little awkwardly. Someone — Ballister suspects a hidden Nimona, because he can see no obvious source — starts to clap and cheer. He rolls up the constitution and tucks it under his arm. “Good work, everyone.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona bounces around the cart as it takes them home. “I did good, didn’t I, boss?” she asks, punching Ballister in the shoulder. “Getting everyone to like you? It turned out okay.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“There was a remarkable lack of chaos,” Ballister admits. He grabs the back of her shirt as she leans over the edge of the cart to snap her teeth at a low-flying pigeon.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin turns away from the road, where he has been watching the palace disappear behind them. “The kingdom is lucky to have you,” he says. Nimona twists around in her seat. “Both of you,” he adds.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona makes a face and snuggles into Ballister’s side. She tugs the edge of his cloak out from him so that she can wrap herself in it for warmth. When Ballister looks down, he catches a glimpse of fangs. “I’m a vicious monster,” she reminds Goldenloin.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin points at the patch over his right eye. “Trust me — I know. But you still did good.” He glances up at Ballister and gives him a slight nod.

At the doorstep, Nimona flings herself inside with a gleeful shout of “Time for s’mores!”and Ballister holds Goldenloin back when he starts to follow her inside. It’s snowing, late winter snow that’s going to turn to slush and freeze over by the morning, but there's more privacy in the muffled white snow than there is inside.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“We can talk now, if you still want to,” says Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What?” asks Goldenloin.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You wanted to talk, and I cut you off because it was the day that the Society for the Responsible Redistribution was in the newspaper, and I was afraid, do you remember?” Ballister prods, because Goldenloin is not taking the hint that he assumed he would.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin blinks at him a few times before he gets it. “That was months ago. I assumed you just didn’t want to talk because you were too busy."
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I did have a lot on my mind,” Ballister admits. "I didn't have enough room for other things."
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Ah, right.” Goldenloin nods.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Good.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Someone yells at their horse a few streets over, and cart wheels rattle against the cobblestones in the distance. Ballister Blackheart and Ambrosius Goldenloin look at each other.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I wish,”—
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I love,”—
</p>
<br>
<p>
They both stop. Goldenloin holds up his hand. “I wish I hadn’t let them give me that lance,” he says. “I wish I had apologized to you sooner."
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I love you,” says Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The window by the front door swings open, and Nimona leans out, chin in her hands and marshmallows already stuffed in her cheeks. “Hey Sir Fancypants, how many marshmallows do you want in your s’more?” she asks, voice muffled.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin frowns.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“We were about to have a moment,” Ballister informs her.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona looks between them. She swallows her marshmallows. “Ohhhhh,” she says, and sinks from view towards the floor. “I'll just ... wait. Bye. See you soon.” A hand reaches up for the window to pull it shut and latch it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister and Goldenloin look at each other. Ballister moves his hand up to Goldenloin’s face. He glances around, but they are alone on this road in the wet, quiet evening. When he looks back, Goldenloin drapes his arms around his neck, and then they are kissing, and Ballister has to readjust his arm because Goldenloin is leaning on him for support now, and snow lands on his eyelashes before he remembers to shut his eyes, and it is unexpectedly familiar and wonderful, all of it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister leans back and smiles. He tries and fails to think of something better to say to complete the moment, but Goldenloin runs a hand through his hair and pulls him in close.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What are s’mores?” he whispers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister laughs. In a burst of joy, he pushes the door open ahead of them and sweeps Goldenloin into his arms. “Come in and see,” he says.
