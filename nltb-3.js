<h3> When There's Nothing Left to Burn, Chapter 3 </h3>
<p> Written by strix_alba on AO3 </p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>
Nimona finds him under the stage again after she’s done making a speech about change and reform that’s … actually quite good. Once he's gotten over the worst of the shock, Ballister catches himself engaging with her words: modifying the grand plans that she presents to her audience in order to give them a few extra nuances and less room for explosions; and when she tells an inspiring anecdote that concludes with a call to examine preconceptions about what is a necessary evil and what's just plain evil masquerading as necessity, he is trying to figure out how best to rewrite the way that dangerous substances are confiscated and then amassed by the Institution, and how to do that differently.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister knows that he shouldn’t assume much about her at this point, but it still surprises him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Did you write that speech yourself?” he asks her.
</p>
<br>
<p>
She hauls him along to the back of the stage. “Huh? Come on, do you want to hang out under here all day? You’ve got kind of a lot of enemies for that.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“No! But listen, we can’t go back to the lab right away,” —
</p>
<br>
<p>
—”Deal. Okay, saddle up, and don’t expect me to do this again.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister opens his mouth to ask her what she means. Before the words leave his mouth, she shifts, his features blurring and body twisting into a draft horse with a saddle and reins that are precisely the same shade of red as her coat. Horse-Nimona tosses her head and stamps at him impatiently, as if to say get on with it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Oh,” he says. “Right.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
As soon as he is securely seated, Nimona trots out from underneath the stage, into the low-angled sunlight of afternoon. Ballister pulls his hat down further over his face to shield his eyes, clutches the reins with the hand that isn’t hanging onto his coat-rack-staff, and tries to at least look like he has control over where they’re going.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona takes him away from the plaza and through the city, all the way out past the public library, without stopping or slowing down.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Wait,” Ballister says. “Stop for a moment.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She bobs her head and makes a sharp turn into an alley narrow enough that Ballister could touch the walls on either side, if he felt like it. He slides off of her back onto the pavement. Nimona melts into herself again — the version that he’s used to seeing, he corrects himself — and folds her arms across her chest, less boisterous than she was at the rally. “What’s wrong with the lab?” she asks him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister looks around, ready to hide her from anyone who might recognize her, but as long as no one looks too closely as they walk by the alleyway, they should be all right. “There’s nothing wrong with the lab. I threw out your rats because they started getting moldy. And there’s … ” He hesitates. Goldenloin and Nimona haven’t had a single interaction in which they weren’t actively trying to kill each other. Last time, they had nearly succeeded.
</p>
<br>
<p>
But he also has a very, very recent reminder of how badly things have gone when he hasn't put all of his cards on the table, and Nimona is still watching him, guarded. He’s missed her face. It would be better to have it around. “Sir Goldenloin — the knight from the Institution — survived. He’s staying with me.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona makes a face like she's swallowed spoiled milk. “Why?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister swallows. “He’s important to me.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You wouldn’t let me kill him,” she recalls, pursing her lips. “And he wouldn’t let the guards hurt you.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Yes, he’s …” Ballister trails off. “I didn’t tell him that I saw you outside the hospital last week."
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Why, you’re afraid he’s going to try to finish me off?” Nimona shrugs. “We’ve already established that it doesn’t work.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister imagines Goldenloin hoisting his sword, trying to fight Nimona in the living room, and his stomach twists in on itself. “Please don’t hurt him.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona flops onto the ground, barely missing a puddle leftover from the rain yesterday. She pulls her feet in towards herself, sitting cross-legged and looking up at him through her bangs. The rest of her hair has started to grow out, enough to leave a noticeable red fuzz. Ballister wonders how it is that it grows when she appears to have spent most of the last three or four weeks as Ballister Blackheart, but he knows better than to ask for details. “So is he going to be around for a while?” she asks. “Like, in your life?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
It feels odd to be looming over her from such a height: standing in front of her exit from the alley, while she sits with her back to the wall. Ballister moves off to one side so he can kneel down, stiffly. “I don’t know. I hope,”— and then he isn’t sure how to finish that sentence.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Are you secretly friends?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister clicks his right hand against the cast on his left. It feels as though he is kneeling over the edge of a deep precipice, albeit in the most unlikely of settings. “No. Yes. We were.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Okay…”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I loved him. I — I still love him.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona is quiet.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“No one knew. It seemed pointless to mention it to you.” Ballister takes a long breath — his bruised ribs only pain him a little these days. “I didn’t actually mean to — that wasn’t what I wanted to tell you first. I wanted to say I’m sorry for hurting you. You’re still my friend, if you want to be.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
"If I got angry, if I split me in two now, would you do it again?" Nimona asks. She looks down at the ground in front of his knees, not at his face. "Would you try to kill me again?"
</p>
<br>
<p>
He starts to reach out to her before he knows what he’s doing; wants more than anything to give her a hug here in the slightly damp dirt of a gloomy alley and tell her that no one will ever hurt her again. She doesn’t acknowledge his outstretched hand, and he lets it drop, fighting the physical ache in his chest. “I would,” he says. “I would have to.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona nods, lifts her head and stares straight over his shoulder. “Yeah. That’s why I figured you’d be a good king.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister does a double-take. He can’t help it. “You did?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She shrugs. "You care about people. You might spread fake infections to prove a point, but you don't want to actually kill anyone."
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What were you thinking?” he demands. “What if I hadn’t found out what you were doing? Why did you write that paper?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Long story,” she says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I want to hear it.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You would.” She gets up, and holds out her hands to pull him to his feet as well. She hangs onto his metal hand as they leave the alley. “If Sir Goldenloin is staying with you, does that mean he’s a villain now, too?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister snickers at the thought. “Hardly.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
Telling Goldenloin about Nimona is a little harder. She follows him inside his headquarters as a soot-colored mouse, hiding herself in the umbrella stand with her tail just sticking out from the folds of a black umbrella. Ballister turns the problem over in his mind as he makes Goldenloin sit on a real chair so he can unwind the bandages from around his arm and shoulder and head. It’s becoming easier to clean and redress the injuries, with less gore and only mild pained hissing from his patient.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Are you going to tell me how the rally went?” Goldenloin asks.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Hold still,” Ballister instructs him, holding his chin in place with one hand so he can swipe alcohol down his cheek uninhibited. “Well. The good news is that I know why half the kingdom thinks that I should be their new king.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin’s mouth twitches into half a smile. Ballister snorts. “Stop that, or you’ll have a permanent smirk.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
He drops the expression. ”What’s the bad news?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Right on cue, Nimona climbs out of the umbrella stand and prances over in the form of an incredibly fluffy forest cat. Ballister positions himself in front of Goldenloin, arm across his chest to both shield him and restrain him; Goldenloin looks up at him with a slight frown. Nimona sits down on the floor a few feet from the chair and shifts into a human girl with her hands folded in her lap. Ballister can’t help smiling at the sight of her; it feels like a long, long time since he’s seen her most familiar face in their headquarters.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Hi,” she says, with a small wave.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin’s hands come up to pull Ballister away from her, as though he thinks he's even capable of defending himself, let alone both of them at once. All of the color that has been creeping back into his face since he left the hospital drains away, but his voice, when he speaks, is steady. “She — you’re alive. How did you survive?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona just shrugs. “He says he trusts you,” she tells Goldenloin, jerking her head at Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin nods, although this close, Ballister can see his jaw vibrate as his teeth chatter. “He said the same about you.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“So you think he’s way too trusting, right?” Nimona says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Yes,” Goldenloin spits out.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona looks up at Ballister. “That’s two things in common,” she says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Tell him,” says Ballister. He picks up the medical tape from the table by the chair and stretches out a piece long enough to secure the new bandages over Goldenloin’s face. He doesn’t have to tell Goldenloin not to move around this time; he is still staring stiffly at Nimona, hands clenched into useless fists.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What, the things? One, we think you’re dumb. Don’t make me say the other one. It’s not cool.” Nimona makes a face.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I meant, tell him what you’ve been up to,” Ballister corrects her.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I don’t think he’s dumb,” Goldenloin protests.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Uh-huh,” says Nimona. “It’s story time.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
"Once I got better, I was a trout for a while. I got to do that for like, a week, but then this old guy bagged me in his net when I was in the middle of my new school, so I ditched the water and went back with him as a dog. I found out when I was a dog that I didn’t do a good enough job wrecking everything, and there was still gonna be that woman advising your new king." 
</p>
<br>
<p>
She nods at Ballister. "I made sure I didn’t kill the stupid princess, okay? She’s not old enough to know better, so I let her go. But they would’ve tried to start everything over again, and everyone was just gonna let them."
</p>
<br>
<p>
— "They wouldn’t" —
</p>
<br>
<p>
"They would’ve. Not enough people were going to say anything.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"Writing everything down, that was easy. Figuring out what to do with it, that was different. I was hanging around the fishing docks when I heard some little kids playing pretend that they were Sir Blackheart and Sir Goldenloin and the Director. The first two kids fought a duel with the Director, and won, and then the Director switched so they were the King, and put you in charge of the Institution.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"I thought that was kind of stupid. It's not just the Director, it's the whole rotten group of them working there. Switching up the boss isn't going to fix that. But it did give me an idea. I thought it was a pretty good one. So I put your signature on my plans and then stuck them up all over the place to see if anyone noticed. I've seen enough of your handwriting to practice it until it looked right."
</p>
<br>
<p>
“People noticed,” says Ballister. “At what point were you going to tell me about this?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
"You were supposed to pick up the slack on that one. You’re a villain, aren’t you supposed to crave power? When those Society for Science people couldn’t find you, and the hospital said you were pretty hurt, I figured you were probably just hiding so no one would come after you while you’re weak," Nimona says, like it's obvious.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“And that’s not a problem for you,” Goldenloin says. "If someone were to try to hurt Ballister expecting him to be injured, and instead they get you..."
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona grins. "Then they're in big trouble."
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona bounces to her feet at the conclusion of her tale. “What do you think? Pretty crafty plan, don’t you think?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
It’s a lot to digest at once. Ballister has sort of worked out parts of it for himself — the impersonation part, mostly — but the sheer scope of it is a little overwhelming. And surprisingly subtle, for Nimona. “It’s certainly something,” he muses.

“We need to talk,” says Goldenloin to Ballister. “Alone,” he adds, with a glance at Nimona.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona frowns at him. “Where do you wanna meet tomorrow, boss?” she asks Ballister. “You don’t have any big appearances planned...”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I don’t have anything planned until we talk about this further,” he informs her. “Period.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She says nothing.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I mean it. You were wrong: I don’t want to be king. I don’t crave power.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona fidgets. Ballister stares her down. She looks away first, rubbing her arm. “You want me to call the whole thing off?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Not … not yet. Just stop it for now.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She sighs. “I’m gonna go play with the gang of dogs down the street,” she says. “I’ll probably be gone a couple of hours.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
The door shuts behind her; Ballister catches a glimpse of her form dwindling in size before he and Goldenloin are alone in the living room. Goldenloin stares at the door, grip still tight on Ballister’s shirt. Ballister pries his fingers loose as gently as possible and draws him to his feet; together, they make the journey from chair to couch. “She’s gone,” Ballister tells him. “It’s going to be okay.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’m not afraid of her,” Goldenloin informs him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister lets the statement stand unchallenged. “Of course.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You’re going to just bring her back now?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin draws his knees closer, curling into Ballister’s side and frowning.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister clears his throat. “She’s never used the guest bedroom — I wouldn’t make you leave unless you didn’t want to stay.” The thought of Goldenloin choosing to be alone instead makes him crumple a bit inside, but he would understand.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin shakes his head. “I don’t want to leave you again. I just want to know why you trust her so much, even after what she did.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“The only reason your people caught her was because she came to rescue me, even though she was angry with me.” Ballister grasps Goldenloin’s hands. “I fought the Institution for years without accomplishing as much as I did once she came. And she’s my best friend.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“She destroyed buildings that still had people in them. The king is dead because of her!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“After they experimented on her and tortured her until she split in two. You saw what they did. She could have left, but she came back to try to fix things.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“By inciting unrest and impersonating you. She’s putting you in danger.” Goldenloin tightens his grip on Ballister’s hands.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I wanted change. I have to do something with it. It’s a risk I’m willing to take,” says Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What happens if the kingdom finds out that you’ve been letting a monster impersonate you so that she can become king? They’ll come after you, and I won’t be able to protect you.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Do you have a better idea?” asks Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin falls silent. He looks down at the floor, frown lines on his face exaggerated by the light from the open lab door. “No,” he says. “I just wish I did.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
It’s still early in the evening, but it’s been a long day. Ballister nods off, and only wakes up when Nimona lets herself back in and shakes his shoulder. “Hey, boss,” she whispers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Hnnn,” he mumbles, squinting. His neck is bent at a strange angle, cracking when he tries to straighten up. It takes a moment before he gets his bearings. He is still sitting on the couch, head back against the cushions, good shoulder weighed down by Goldenloin’s head. (He has a sneaking suspicion that there is drool on his shirt, and it's not his own.) Nimona leans over the back of the couch.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Hey boss, am I going to scare your nemesis if I hang around?” she whispers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister stretches as much as he can without waking Goldenloin. “Don’t turn into anything bigger than him, please.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She snorts quietly. “Weenie.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You nearly killed him.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Doesn’t bother you,” she shoots back.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“It does, but I know you. He doesn’t yet.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona makes a face that is difficult to decipher in the dark. “Yeah, okay. Night, boss.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
After she vanishes to wherever she goes when she sleeps, Ballister groans and tries to rouse Goldenloin because he is comforted by the way that his body feels pressed against his side, but he knows that it will be a lot less comfortable if they doesn’t move for the rest of the night. He manages to get them both awake enough to stagger to the guest room, where he sets Goldenloin down and then collapses onto the bed himself. Neither of them are large men, so there is plenty of room. By the time he turns out the lamp, Goldenloin is already asleep again.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Lying on his back on the bed, Ballister thinks. He tries to picture himself as king, the way that Nimona seems to see him. The only conclusion he reaches is that his neck would probably snap under the weight of the Royal Crown.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He scraps that image. Not a king, just … a leader. Leading people down the path of truth and science. A pathway to an enormous laboratory full of bubbling beakers and titration filters and machinery that whirs, shows them how to use the Institution’s weapons as energy sources. A pathway where children are not snatched off the streets by the government and trained to be soldiers and knights, but study or play or build things with people from the outside world instead.
</p>
<br>
<p>
A pathway that has, next to all of these things, a laboratory next door to a house big enough for two former knights and a shapeshifter.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister is wide awake. He slides off the bed with as little sound as possible, lets himself out of the room, and hurries to pull on his dressing gown in his own, considerably colder, room. Then he sits down at his desk and starts to draft some plans of his own.
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
True to her word, Nimona does not make any more appearances as Ballister (Or, if she does, then she keeps them quiet enough that he doesn’t know about it). She does do a little hop of glee when he asks her to help him arrange for a speech on the steps of the temporary palace. Nimona flits around the city in various forms, goading, threatening, and cajoling reporters and town criers until everyone knows that Sir Ballister Blackheart will appear at the wreckage site of the primary royal palace to discuss his recent campaign for king.
</p>
<br>
<p>
On the appointed date, Nimona joins him on the sweeping steps of the palace as an enormous, square-jawed bodyguard. He catches her bending over Goldenloin — wearing a hooded cloak to keep his face in shadow and hide his injuries — just before they begin, talking in a low voice. Goldenloin looks up at her, nods, and touches her shoulder before she struts over to the stage.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I told him I’d make sure you don’t get hurt,” she rumbles.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Thank you,” he says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Standing in front of this many people is … not new, exactly, but he was never great at publicity, even when he was younger. Neither his face nor his personality inspire the kind of confidence required; there are many reasons why Goldenloin was the Institution’s golden boy. Nimona had managed to make his image work for her, but she’s also Nimona.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Five hundred-odd pairs of eyes watch him. He clears his throat and imagines that he’s speaking just to Nimona, off to his left, and just to Goldenloin, sitting in the third row. He skips quickly through the introductory remarks, which are basically the same for every public presentation, and dives into the body paragraphs before he can think too much about it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’ve thought about being king quite a lot recently. I could finally do things the way they should be done. Legislation to oversee weapons experimentation to make sure that dangerous materials are contained safely and living beings are not subjected to inhumane tests solely because they have potential military value. Diversifying our defenses so the kingdom isn’t only being protected by one person and their interests and private army. I could do those things. But after discussing the situation with others who are close to it, I have decided that I would not be an adequate king.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
He waits for the crowd’s reaction to die down. A trio of grey-armored warriors exits the fudge shop on the right-hand side of the plaza. They are carrying halberds and do not look as though they were in the store to buy creamy sugar confections. A knot forms in Ballister's stomach.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I can combine chemicals, and I can build myself an arm, but I can’t do those and also run a kingdom. Not one as large and prosperous as ours, not if we want it to stay large and prosperous.” He lists the ways in which the kingdom is prosperous, which he still thinks is unnecessary but which Goldenloin insisted on including. (”Remind them how wonderful they are, and how much they have to lose,” he said bitterly, "That always worked on me.") “But I know that I have the trust of the people, and I will do what I can to prove that I have earned that trust. I can’t rebuild our kingdom on my own; but I can search for those who are capable, who are motivated for the good of the people of the kingdom, not just the institution of the kingdom. Not every single person who worked for the Institution believed in their ideals, and not everyone who claims to be impartial is. If you trust me to, I will find out the truth. I will lead you for as long as it takes to ensure that when I step down, the kingdom will not fall apart, or turn back to the same layers of secrets and lies as before.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona slips away off at his side, and he tries not to look nervous as he reads down the page. There is a ping of blue light at the corner of his vision. He breaks off. Nimona waves at him in a way that is obviously meant to be reassuring, but she does it while wielding a glowing spear recently liberated from one of the warriors. Ballister takes a steadying breath before continuing.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He makes it all the way through the rest of the prepared statement without incident, and even manages to answer a few questions. And when he finally steps down from the steps, almost every person on the lawn rises to their feet. The air fills with cheers, stamping and shouting, and Ballister only barely prevents himself from going slack-jawed with surprise and wonder. There are more than a few soured faces in his audience, but there are hundreds and hundreds of people around him celebrating, excited, and they will never know the real driving force behind his success.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin reaches out to him when he approaches, and Ballister draws him to his feet, into a tight hug. “Thank you,” Goldenloin shouts into his ear. “For a few days, I thought you were planning to take over the kingdom.” Ballister just holds on, half supporting him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
When they break apart, Nimona is there, waiting. She raises an eyebrow at them. Goldenloin holds out his hand to her, steadying himself on Ballister’s shoulder. “I saw what you did,” he says. “Thank you.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona eyes him up. “I don’t watch out for him for you.” But she shakes Goldenloin’s hand, and Ballister feels a small bubble of hope rising in his chest.
