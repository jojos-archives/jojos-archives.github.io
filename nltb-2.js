<h3> When There's Nothing Left to Burn, Chapter 2 </h3>
<p> Written by strix_alba on AO3 </p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>
The blood drains from his head. He reads over the signature several times to make sure that he’s not seeing things incorrectly, but it remains his handwriting claiming ownership of the text above.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He leans on the solid wooden doorway and pulls himself inside the bar. Although it’s only a little past noon outside, the interior is already dark, with the occasional gap in the beams of the roof that permits a crack of sunlight to slice through the thick stale air and strike one of the chairs that are mostly empty this early in the day. There’s a few people around the bar; Ballister recognizes about half of them as just having come in from the crowd outside. He finds the barkeep by her hair when she leans across the bar to collect someone’s change off the other side. Ballister finds a gap between two slender fishlike women at the bar and squeezes himself in. He holds up a glove-covered hand and waits for the barkeep to spot him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What can I get you?” she asks.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“That poster outside,” Ballister says. “Where did it come from?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She shrugs. “Hell if I know. Damned thing just showed up here this morning, and I thought well, it’s a public venue. I’m just giving the public a platform to voice their opinions. Not the usual platform, but …”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“When did it go up?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
The barkeep turns away for a moment to refill someone’s tankard with a suspicious purple liquid from the tap. “Wasn’t there when I opened up this morning. Didn’t know about it until Jarred kicked up a fuss about it because he’s too cloud-headed to realize that ‘jaderoot’s not spelled the same way as ‘draft beer’.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister frowns. “Thank you,” he says, and slides off the stool. The world swims before him, too much to blame on just the hazy atmosphere of the tavern. “Excuse me.”
</p>
<br>

Goldenloin takes a full day longer than Dr. Fayadse predicted to be able to stand upright without falling over, but eventually, he is ready to leave the hospital, and Ballister executes his first plan that involves absolutely no publicity stunts or calculated mayhem. There was a moderate amount of mayhem, initially, but the delay means their departure will coincide with the coronation of the new king. He can take Goldenloin back to the lair while most of the city’s population is either at the secondary palace, or watching the event on televisions indoors.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’m not sure this degree of precaution is necessary,” Goldenloin says for the third time today — this time, in reference to the knot into which Ballister is winding his hair. Ballister doesn’t bother to respond. The bandages and new-forming scars make his face less recognizable, but his hair remains distinctive and far too noticeable. Ballister pins it in place and tugs a woolen cap over the finished product.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The nurse returns with several sheets of paper, a bundle of bandages, and a small ceramic jar in her arms. “You’ll need to sign yourself out,” she says. “Change the bandages at sunrise and sunset, and clean the wounds with this cream. You should come back in a few days to check in.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“We’ll see how he’s doing,” Ballister says, ignoring the way that Goldenloin gives him a bemused look. “Thank you very much for everything,” He clasps her hands in an inadequate attempt to convey gratitude and awe. Goldenloin smiles and pats her back and then staggers and leans heavily on her until Ballister wraps his metal arm around Goldenloin’s waist, transferring most of his weight to his own shoulder instead of the poor nurse.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The cart and horse that Ballister arranged to take them away are waiting in front of the hospital. (More or less. The alleged horse is actually a fat donkey, but they’re just trying to get to the front door before the coronation ceremony is over, not escaping the oncoming hordes, so Ballister is willing to overlook it.) He arranges a blanket and a few pillows on the bottom of the cart and deposits Goldenloin on top of them. Sitting on the floor next to him takes a little more effort than it did when he was younger and not as injured, but he manages all right.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Where are we going?” Goldenloin asks. He is clearly nervous as the cart rattles away from the cobblestone roads onto a less well-maintained dirt street. The dirt road is lined by shabby thatched houses; the only other figures on the street are a pair of dogs nosing at fast food wrappers and an old woman sitting on her front stoop with a basket of wool and a drop spindle. Ballister knows that the emptiness can only work in their favor, as planned, but even to him it feels slightly sinister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You didn’t think I lived somewhere easy to get to, did you?” Ballister asks. The cart’s back wheel runs over a small ditch in the road, jolting them both. Goldenloin stifles a cry of pain. Ballister holds him in place with a hand on his shoulder. “Watch where you’re taking us,” he snaps at the driver.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“This isn’t my first time on the wounded warrior transportation circuit, hon,” the driver replies. “It hurts ‘em more if we keep making big sweeps to avoid little potholes. Trust me.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister scowls. “If he dies, I will blame you.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
The driver cracks the donkey’s reins and doesn’t look back. “That’s fair.”
</p>
<br>
<p>

</p>
<br>
<p>
The guest bedroom has been set up for company for the first time in years, but it’s only mid-afternoon when they arrive at the front door, so Ballister deposits Goldenloin onto the living room couch instead. The springs are a little worn out, because nice furniture is hard to come by when one is a public enemy, but the fabric is soft and there’s more light here than in the guest room.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Once he’s sure that Goldenloin isn’t going to fall off the couch or faint, Ballister turns on the rice cooker in the kitchen (for Goldenloin) and puts leftover pizza in the oven (for himself). While he waits for lunch, he remembers that they’re missing one of the biggest political celebrations in recent memory, goes back into the living room, and turns the television on low. Goldenloin is already asleep again.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The news anchor on the television is standing in front of a large crowd, in a large open area that Ballister recognizes as the secondary palace where the coronation is being held. The banners are mostly black, to honor the abrupt death of the King and several key members of his cabinet, and the few overdressed aristocrats milling about in the background are also wearing dress shirts with one black sleeve.
</p>
<br>
<p>
There’s also an unusual amount of movement and noise from the crowd, given the occasion. Could the formal part of the coronation be over already?
</p>
<br>
<p>
The timer on the rice cooker dings in the kitchen, but Ballister remains seated on the arm of the couch. He turns the volume up a couple of notches, just enough to make out the anchor’s words.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Witnesses have reported several members of the extended Royal Family fleeing the scene with Princess Isabel, including the Duke of Islington and Sir Jeremiah Lightfoot. Here at News Channel 6, we have not been able to get visual confirmation of any of these reports.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What,” says Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Baronet Cienaga, what can you tell us about today’s protests?” says the anchor to one of the aristocrats behind her.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Baronet wrings her hands, eyes darting back and forth. She doesn’t say anything for a moment. The anchor starts to turn back to the camera when the Baronet seizes the microphone. “They were only trying to protect us! Don’t you see?” she cries, and then hurls herself into the middle of the crowd behind the anchor.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What,” says Ballister.
</p>
<br>
<p>

<br>
<p>
Goldenloin wakes up about halfway through the afternoon. Ballister moves to shut off the television so he won't have to worry about the news immediately, but Goldenloin insists that he needs to know what's going on. As soon as he gets the gist of the story, he begins to fidget and make abortive attempts to stand up. “I have to go to the palace,” he says. “My kingdom needs me!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Not right now it doesn’t.” Ballister pushes him back down onto the couch.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“As a symbolic gesture of solidarity. I know there’s no monster to fight, but I could still,” — he mimes fencing with an invisible enemy — “show the people I’m there for them. I’m not with the Institution anymore.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You can’t even walk on your own right now. How could you possibly ‘be there’ for anyone?” Ballister observes without thinking.
</p>
<br>
<p>
A cloud crosses Goldenloin’s face; eyes downcast, he turns away. Ballister listens to the echo of his own words hanging in the air and winces. “Never mind that. I,”— He sighs, and mutes the television. Goldenloin doesn’t protest this time, just shifts his legs, giving Ballister enough room to sit down by his hip. “You haven’t been there for me before, but you were this time. I appreciate it. I’m sure you’ve protected other people before, too.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I saved thirteen people from an enchanted boar last spring,” Goldenloin says. It comes out petulant, pleading for recognition.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister definitely hasn’t missed that tone. There’s nothing endearing about it (that he can put his finger on, anyway). “I heard about that.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I didn’t kill it. I didn’t think you would want me to.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister looks down at his own hands and nods. He runs his metal fingers over the rough fabric of the cast on his left wrist. “Thank you.” Pause. He feels like he should say something more. “Would you like any tea?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin blinks up at him. “Yes. Please. I drink herbal teas now.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister pulls a face. He would make a remark about not knowing Goldenloin anymore, but the subject is still too close for comfort, so he settles on, “I only have ginseng, sorry. Nimona,” — a rush of sadness — “Nimona drank everything else.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin mumbles something else, but Ballister is already in the living room. He glances at the news, which is still covering the coronation riot. It would appear that the Princess Isabel is safe and unharmed, and Ballister is glad. Whatever his feelings about her family, or her scientific value as a candidate for cloning, the girl is seven years old. She doesn’t deserve the brunt of any fallout that may come her way. He lights the stove under the kettle and begins to clean the area for the fourth time in as many days. The counter is as clean as the least-dirty rag in his possession, plus a small amount of magically enhanced soap from the farmer’s market, can get it; but he’s always spilling things without realizing it, so one more wipe-down can’t hurt.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The kettle begins to whistle, and Ballister pours the tea. “Ballister,” Goldenloin calls from the next room.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As evenly as he can, Ballister collects the two mugs of steeping tea and brings them back to the living room. He sets them down on the thick tree stump that serves as a side table, which leaves the arm that isn’t in a sling free to help Goldenloin with his quest to rearrange the cushions so he can sit upright.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister passes him the tea. “Do you need anything else?"
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin shakes his head and points at the television.
</p>
<br>
<p>
There’s a different reporter this time, standing in a large crowd of civilians gathered in front of the secondary palace. Amidst the sea of heads, there are a few signs and posters, including one that appears to be made out of a rug on a wooden frame. Below the rug-sign, just behind the reporter’s head, is a group of demonstrators, rallying behind a slightly smaller sign with a portrait on it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister’s portrait, to be precise. And underneath, thick gothic script spells out King Blackheart.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister stares, heart pounding. There he is, on his television screen, for other scientists and ordinary citizens and Princess Isabel to see. How did he get there? Why is he there in the first place? He hopes that seeing his name in unexpected public places doesn’t develop into a pattern.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You’re on TV,” says Goldenloin.
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
At least, Ballister consoles himself, he’s not actually on television. No one can possibly think that he’s actually trying to use the smoking wreckage of the kingdom’s political infrastructure to further a new career path, can they? It’s just a few people with some strange ideas in their heads.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Of course, Goldenloin still wants an explanation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I swear, I don’t know where anyone got that idea,” Ballister repeats. “I’ve never suggested it myself.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Then lay low until it goes away,” Goldenloin suggests.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He takes Goldenloin’s suggestion to heart for the next week and a half, only leaving his headquarters to buy food and more gauze, or to take Goldenloin to the hospital. He gets his own arm x-rayed, and is informed that he can leave it out of the sling, although the cast will have to stay on for another month. But Ballister has dealt with his entire arm being blown off, and he gets to keep his left arm at the end of all of this, and that’s reason enough to celebrate in his opinion. He stops just short of skipping out of the doctor’s office, as that would be both uncomfortable and undignified. On the short walk from the doctor’s office to the hospital, he buys a broadside from a small child bundled in half a dozen sweaters against the chill. It’s the second informal newspaper of its ilk that he’s noticed in the last week, although it’s printed on better-quality paper. Institution Director Indicted! reads the headline. Below it is an artistically rendered impression of the Director. He blinks at the title, but apparently enough people wanted to see the Director put on trial that it had become a moot point as to whether or not she was actually still alive to stand charges. The column to one side of the page informs him that the Vice-Director Of Experimental Biology To Stand Trial As Well — the intended regent for Princess Isabel. A small quote inset in the main article claims that Ballister told “the press” that the only monster he ever fought was the Institution. Ballister pauses at that — he’s sure that he only ever said so to the egg-seller, but maybe she’s decided to enter the field of print media.
</p>
<br>
<p>
However that quote was obtained, it’s true, so Ballister doesn’t let it linger too long in his thoughts as he goes to collect Sir Goldenloin from the hospital so that they can return to his headquarters. Goldenloin is sitting in the waiting room, reading the same broadside, elbows resting on the armrest of a sky blue wheelchair. He looks up when Ballister joins him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Have you been talking to reporters?” he asks Ballister, who shakes his head.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“There’s plenty of real news besides just me saying things. They should write about that. Um, nurse…?” he adds to the man in a white jacket sitting next to him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"Sure," says the nurse, putting down his magazine. He grabs the handles on the back of Goldenloin’s wheelchair, and the three of them navigate the maze of plastic chairs down to the front entrance. Goldenloin can get himself upright, but it’s still a chore for him to stay that way. This is easier.
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin is thinking of saying something stupid, Ballister can tell. He’ll level long, meaningful stares in Ballister’s direction whenever they’re in the same room, or he’ll slip things into conversation, references to things from before the tournament. “Do you remember the pine tree outside the window of your old room?” and “I know you know how to do this, you helped me study basic wound care at the academy.” Sometimes Ballister will give in and let him talk about the old days, and sometimes he’ll just respond with a “hmm” and go back to his chemicals or his chalkboard or his attempts not to wince as he bandages the messy part of Goldenloin’s face where his eye used to be.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He knows that at some point they will have to talk about the fact that they don’t seem to be enemies any longer, but as far as he’s concerned, he would rather hold off on starting that conversation until everything around them has settled down a little bit.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Instead of talking, he makes soup for Goldenloin that doesn’t come out of a can, and pulls the lever by the fireplace that will topple another log onto the fireplace, and Goldenloin throws the other half of his blanket over Ballister as they sit down to dinner together. Ballister frowns over the small collection of newspapers that he gathered when he bought food earlier in the day. He’s flipping over to a new broadside when he sees his own name on the back page and pauses.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin touches the back of his wrist, drawing his attention away. “Can we talk?” says Goldenloin.
</p>
<br>
<p>
There it is. “Not now,” Ballister cuts him off, punctuated by a loud crack from the wood in the fireplace.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Ballister,” —
</p>
<br>
<p>
—“Look.” He drapes the newspaper over Goldenloin’s bowl of soup.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin reads. His eye widens. “When did you do any of that?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I didn’t! The only times I’ve been out without you have been to buy supplies,” Ballister defends himself. “I’m a busy man, when would I have had the time to form a political party?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You didn’t form the political party.” Goldenloin points to the article. “But you spoke to the organizers last night, looking ‘heroically battle-weary and ready for action.’” He tilts his head to bring Ballister into his field of vision, as though considering the merits of such a description.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Obviously they’re mistaken. I was in the lab last night,” Ballister points out.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Science again?” Goldenloin asks.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister scowls. “It’s not just ‘science’. I’m trying to devise a way to safely dispose of all of the jaderoot that the Institution has been stockpiling.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin folds the paper. Rather than lean over to put it on the side table, he simply lets it float down to the floor. Ballister rolls his eyes — the man is wounded, yes, but sometimes he’s also just plain lazy. “Is that why there was smoke coming over the top of the door?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
"That was a minor miscalculation," Ballister mutters, but he would rather admit to having accidentally melted one of his beakers than let Goldenloin try to talk about his feelings again.
</p>
<br>
<p>

</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister had expected it to be more difficult to find a potentially disruptive burgeoning political organization, but the next day, the Society for the Responsivle Redistribution of Scientific Advancements posts a recruitment ad in an established newspaper, including an address that turns out to be a two-story house painted a deep ochre hue, wedged between a library and a small collection of wooden shacks. There's even a hastily-painted sign out front when he arrives the following morning. Ballister tries not to look too out of his depth when the door opens and a stocky bronze-skinned woman with a name tag identifying her as Dr. Swanfoot, PhD., pumps his hand.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Sir Blackheart, thank god you’re here. We kept getting your voicemail yesterday, and Jaz really wants to know what you think of our campaign posters. They’re a little rushed, but it’s better to get them out as soon as possible. I heard there’s a few chapters of the Smith’s Guild who want to run Kumeta on a socialist redistribution platform, and while I don't think that she's actually going to run, it's still better to get a head start, just in case. I ask you, does the kingdom really need ready-made blast-weapons technology available to the general public?” She drags him down the hallway and into a tiny office that still has imprints in the floor from where a bed and dresser had been until quite recently. The tiny, wrinkled old man at the desk breaks into a smile when he sees them.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“The press conference has been set up as requested,” he jumps in. “Here, what do you think?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I think you’re mistaken,” Ballister tries to explain; looking down at the stiff piece of paper that has appeared in his possession. It features a picture of himself clutching a test tube of a green glowing substance in one hand.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“About what? Is that not the right color? I’m a neurosurgeon, I don’t know what you experimental chemists get up to,” says Dr. Swanfoot.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“No! I’m not — who told you to make these?” he asks, brandishing them at her.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You did,” they say in unison.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister backs away. He doesn’t need this, not right now. “But I’m not — I didn’t — when was I here?” he asks desperately. “I don’t want any of this.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Dr. Swanfoot looks confused. "But the Declaration of Intent!" she says. "'Away then, with those who cry, "Peace for the kingdom!" and do not bring peace. Make way for those who cry, "Truth! Justice!" and act on those principles. The kingdom can only be saved from the evils perpetrated by the Institution if we are willing to confront them as deformed parodies of good intentions, and bring them back into line with those good intentions.' Did you forget?"
</p>
<br>
<p>
"Did I write that?" Ballister asks, trying to recall more clearly the posters hanging all over the city.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"Lines ninety-three to ninety-five of the Declaration," Jaz offers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"Which reminds me," says Dr. Swanfoot. "We've been having a little debate here at the Society headquarters about exactly what you meant by the lines about the role of private scientific investigations in the defense of the kingdom. Some of us, myself included, think you're talking about abolishing private research altogether, on the off chance that private research groups develop the same sort of secret facilities that resulted in the great black dragon."
</p>
<br>
<p>
She's utterly serious, looking at him like she expects him to have answers. And Ballister does remember nodding along as he read that part of the mysterious Declaration of Intent, so he tries his best. "I don't think that's what the author meant at all," he says. "Research on harmful weapons needs to be contained, especially in the city. If a single thing went wrong at the Institution, they could have poisoned thousands of people!"
</p>
<br>
<p>
Dr. Swanfoot nods. "That's what I keep telling Dr. Caerwent, but she insists it's only applicable to government properties. She's out to lunch right now; you can look at our review of succession laws while we wait for her to get back..."
</p>
<br>
<p>
°。°。°。°。°。°。°
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin isn’t in the living room when Ballister gets back, and he nearly has a heart attack (he’s gone; he’s been kidnapped; he’s tried to strike out on his own) before he hears a light thunk coming from the guest bedroom. The door is open; when he walks in, he sees Goldenloin lying half-propped-up in bed, a throwing knife in his good hand and a pile of used tissues on the bedside table. Ballister turns around: thirteen identical knives have embedded themselves in the wall opposite the bed, at low, lazy angles.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Why are you destroying my wall?” Ballister yanks the closest knife out of the wall.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin drops the hand holding the knife into his lap. “I’m practicing my aim.” He indicates his eye.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister wants to point out that there are other, less destructive ways that he could go about testing his depth perception, ways that don’t include flinging sharp objects at the ambient architecture (where Ballister is letting him stay, without any restrictions or limitations, he might add). He wants to tell Goldenloin that he shouldn’t strain himself, especially not with the long and probably painful movements required to throw knives with any degree of accuracy.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He remembers the first time he tried to joust against a quintain after his arm had healed enough to do so, and he sighs, and lies down on top of the blankets next to Goldenloin instead. “Tell me next time. You’ll need an actual target.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin sets the knife on the bedside table with a clink. A moment later, Ballister feels a hand on his head, fingers winding through his hair. “Thank you,” he hears, so quietly that it takes a moment to process that he heard anything at all. Then, with less of a quiver, “Did you find out how you managed to be in two places at once?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister turns over, so that he is at eye level with the bandages on Goldenloin’s shoulder. “There was some miscommunication,” he says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I couldn’t convince anyone that I’m not the person they’ve been talking to for the last two weeks. I think they thought I was having a moment of panic. And then I ... became distracted.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin’s hand stops halfway through combing his hair. “Oh?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister shuts his eyes. His head hurts. “I argued with a few particle physicists about what to do with the Institution's surviving projects, and then they made me stay for a strategy meeting. According to the head of the Society for the Responsible Redistribution of Scientific Advancement, I’m the only public figure that the kingdom trusts to have their best interests at heart right now. There’s nothing to worry about, I don’t have any real competing candidates, just general opposition to win over.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
The pause is longer this time, silence broken only by the fire in the hearth to protect against the autumn wind and the sounds of two bodies breathing.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“That’s ridiculous. The monarchy doesn’t work like that.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister shrugs. “You always see things as simpler than they are, remember?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin doesn’t answer. His fingers brush past Ballister’s head, settling on his shoulder. “Maybe,” he admits.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister’s failure to show up for the press conference that Dr. Swanfoot mentioned hasn’t seemed to put a cramp in anyone’s plans. He hears about it on the news, although there is no video footage of the event. And it’s become increasingly difficult to leave the house without attracting attention Most of it is handshakes, flowers, and the occasional hug, which are bizarre but not unpleasant. Less pleasant are the dark looks from gray-cloaked figures who generally hurry away when he draws near. On one occasion, he is walking back from the Alchemists’ Street Market when he notices a solitary figure shadowing him (wearing an Institution uniform, really). He hurries into a crowd of people watching a street performer; when he risks taking a look back, his view of the figure is blocked by a burly dock worker, and then the figure is gone. The close call shakes him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
It’s time for a different approach, he decides.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Where are you going?” asks Goldenloin.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister draws his cloak about him with a motion that sends it swirling around his feet. “I’m apparently scheduled to lead a demonstration at the Lorenzo Plaza this afternoon.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“You’re not thinking of showing up?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Of course not.” A glance in the mirror assures him that his fearsome ginger beard is still in place. His hair and forehead are covered by a wide-brimmed straw hat. All he needs is a wooden staff and workman’s gloves to complete his disguise.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Goldenloin narrows his eye. “I don’t believe you.”
</p>

“Don’t ask silly questions, then.” Ballister ducks into his laboratory to retrieve the wooden bar in the closet that usually supports hangers full of lab coats and protective plastic sheeting. It’s been roughed up and stained by enough science over the years that it could reasonably pass for a well-used walking stick. “I’ll be back in time to change your bandages. There’s water on the side table and rice and eggs under the table. Don’t look in the fridge. You understand the remote control now, right?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’m not completely helpless,” Goldenloin protests.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister gives him a look, but he brushes the uninjured part of Goldenloin's cheek with the back of his hand all the same. “Take care of yourself.”

The crowds in the Lorenzo Plaza envelope Ballister the instant that he steps within the boundaries of the square. There are really quite a lot of people — more than he had been expecting, based on the size and state of the Society’s campaign offices. Most of the attendees are jubilant and barely into adulthood, which makes him feel old and cross, but there are enough greybeards and weather-beaten older women around to sooth his conscience or whatever. He slips between two large groups of what appear to be displaced pirates, pushing his way towards the center stage where, it seems, most of the attention is focused. If the false Ballister Blackheart is going to make an appearance, he would bet his fake ginger beard that he’ll find the impostor around here.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He isn’t the first person to get up onto the platform and make a speech that day, though. The first is Dr. Swanfoot, wearing light robes better suited to desert summers than the current temperature. Ballister takes advantage of the distraction that she provides to snake his way further towards the front. He scans the crowd for anyone with dark hair and a telltale arm. Or possibly a telltale glove. He isn’t sure which one the impostor will be wearing.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Dr. Swanfoot has reached a point in her speech patterns that suggests she’ll be wrapping it up soon when Ballister sees: his own face, barely recognizable in profile because unlike some knights, he doesn’t spend a whole lot of time in front of a mirror. Ballister shoves aside the last burly longshoreman between himself and the other Ballister, grabs his double by the arm.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Excuse me,” he says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
His double turns their head to meet his eyes. It’s profoundly unsettling. Ballister resists the urge to step back, look away and pretend that this whole thing didn’t happen and is therefore not something that he needs to deal with. “I’m afraid I don’t have much time to talk right now,” says the impostor. “If you stay right here, I promise I’ll get back to address your concerns after I give my speech.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister tightens his grip on his arm. “I’m not a concerned citizen,” he says. “I’ve discovered your plot, whoever you are.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
The impostor doesn’t respond. Ballister tugs on their wrist; after a moment of resistance, they go easily, letting Ballister haul them away from the crowd and underneath the platform. It isn’t any quieter here, but at least they are less visible. Light makes its way through the generous gaps in the wooden slats of the platform, more than enough for Ballister to make out the details of his own face a foot away, replicated down to the chicken pox scars faded into near-invisibility by his hairline. He tightens his grip on the imposter’s arm to disguise the shaking of his hand.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Who are you?” he hisses. “What do you think you’re doing?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
The imposter’s mouth twitches, like they can’t decide whether to answer or not. Ballister waits. A certain light to their eyes, a tilt of the head, and oh — he knows that expression.
</p>
<br>
<p>
His heart leaps painfully in his chest. “Nimona?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She smiles, less toothy than he’s used to. When she speaks, it’s not his voice she uses, but her own. “Hey, boss. Whaddaya think?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ballister launches himself forwards, wrapping his arms around the impostor — around Nimona — and her arms turn huge and burly and lift him off of his feet. He refuses to cry, not even a little bit, although his eyes do water when she squeezes too tightly around the bruises on his sides. “Ow,” he protests.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Sorry.” She puts him down, and when she steps back, she is once again his mirror image.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I didn’t expect to see you so — how long have you been …” Ballister trails off and trips over his own words. “What are you doing?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Listen, like I told you, I’m a busy man,” Nimona tells him, suddenly brusque. “But I’ll tell you what, if you meet me back here after the rally, we’ll talk, and I’ll see what I can do to help you.” Her eyes flicker off to the left; Ballister follows her gaze, and sees a gangly pale youth leaning under the platform, making frantic gestures to Nimona to come out and lead already. She waves at him, give me a moment. “Unless you want to take it from here?” she asks him in a low voice.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
She shrugs. “Okay with me. See you later.” She flashes him a grin with cat-eyes and sharp teeth, and then she’s gone, hurrying off in a precise imitation of the way that Ballister runs. “I’m coming, Evegeny, don’t worry. The show will go on!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
As soon as she’s out of sight, Ballister sits down in the dirt, hard. The area under the platform might not be any quieter than it is outside, but it’s darker, and free of other people, so no one can see when he covers his face with his hands and tries not to hyperventilate.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nimona is here.
